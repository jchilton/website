<h2>Recycle Bin</h2>
<p>These are ideas that I've had and didn't want to completely abandon
but don't have time for right now. Anything in the recycle bin is up for
grabs. If you want to follow one of these ideas to its natural end, please
email me to let me know you've claimed it.</p>

<ul>
<li>A book called <i>ReMarx: Remarks on the Writings of Karl Marx</i>
    <li>Wow! Foucault already got this one! I promise I didn't see this among his works when I studied his oeuvre as a teenager.</li>
</li>
</li>
<li>A mechanism by which people can give me digital currency &mdash; to support
my art, for example.</li>
</ul>
