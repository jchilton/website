<h1>John's PhD Thesis</h1>
<h2>Byrneglish</h2>
<p>Byrneglish is a dialect of English in which all communication is suggestive
 of the future of the person or people that the Byrneglish speaker is talking
 with or about. In this regard Byrneglish is similar to Foucault's
 "subjectification." The primary difference between Byrneglish and 
subjectification is that Byrneglish is conversational, that is, all speaking
 parties participate in the development of each other, whereas 
subjectification is an inquisitive activity in which an authority on
 personality, personal depth, personal "growth" or "being-in-the-world"
 "rescues" other(s) from "inside-outness," or, lack of uniqueness. Said more
 simply, Byrneglish is a fair and equal trade in learning about while
 developing others' true selves, whereas subjectification is a one-sided 
effort by a party to develop another party, at some cost to the former.<p>

<hr />

<p>Above is the original thesis, which deserves much treatment. A primary
note that must be made and should have been included in the thesis is the
comparison and contrast of Byrneglish and objectification, which is development
of another in a way that that other may or may not want to be developed, and
usually occurs at a cost to the objectified and benefit to the objectifier
&mdash; examples of objectification include visits with a medical doctor or
talking to the police.</p>
