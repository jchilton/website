<h1>John's Original Scholarship</h1>

<ul>

<li><a href="thesis.html">PhD in Byrneglish</a>, Oct. 18, 2006 &mdash; awarded
 by James P. Byrne, of the
institution tentatively named the Sierra Hotel Institute of Technology.</li>

<li>Currently working on an ethnography "as lived experience" of homelessness
in Boston centering on the Woods-Mullen shelter and including as many other
organizations in the area as I would naturally visit during the course of my
homelessness.</li>

<li>I plan to write an ethnography of jail, as well. Last time I went to jail
 the person I'd transgressed against (and the prosecution) realized I was
 in it for the field work
 and so
the system worked very hard to quickly get me out of jail. Next time I will 
research crimes that are, as always, non-violent however will land me in the
slammer for a longer period of time so that I can effectively understand and
write about jail culture.</p>
